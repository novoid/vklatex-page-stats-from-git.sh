If you are managing a LaTeX document within a git repository, you
might want to see, how the page numbers evolved over time.

: USAGE:   vklatex-page-stats-from-git.sh /path/to/repository

This leads to the log file:
/path/to/vklatex-page-stats-from-git.sh.log

You can [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep][grep]] for lines starting with "RESULT:" and then you get
something like this:

: RESULT: 95c3fb0503192141xxef237a85f85bfd0c5925a7 2012-08-22T18:50:40 99

** customization

Look into the script file to modify following things:

- LOGFILE: file where the logs should be written to (better do outside of TEXDIR)
- WAITFORCOMPILING: time to wait for compilation process to end

** known bugs/issues

Sorry, I was not able to fix one thing: the mechanism to remember the
[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process_identifier][PID]] of the sub-process which is compiling the LaTeX document.

Therefore you get lines like the second from the example above where
the page number is missing. This is a commit, where the compilation
command did not finish within the WAITFORCOMPILING time.

** things that would be nice (volunteers?)

- fix issue(s) from above
- automatically generate page number histogram using R/gnuplot/...
- cache old runs + run update iterations
- being able to determine start-commit and end-commit (range)
